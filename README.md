# QA-Test-Portfolio

In this portfolio you will find white and black box test case. I decided to start with those two specifically because they adress other types of test cases and i believe that it suits me well to perform in such a more complex analysis.

Both test cases (more are coming by the way) shows my hability to understand code and the path it wants to take, in the white box case for example.

In the black box test case i wanted to show my analitycal view and capacity to catch all the mistakes that could break the web page or all the scenarios that could make the users interaction difficult. 

Both test cases are from my own two personal school projects. Black box test case web page is for a dog's walker service and white box is for a airline booking services.
